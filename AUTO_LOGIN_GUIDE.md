# Auto-Login Feature Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

The Electron app now supports persistent login so you only need to enter credentials once!

### 🔧 Features Added:

1. **Secure Credential Storage**
   - Credentials encrypted using AES-256-CBC
   - Stored in user data directory
   - Automatically cleared on logout

2. **Auto-Login on Startup**
   - App automatically tries saved credentials when starting
   - Shows loading spinner during auto-login
   - Falls back to normal login if auto-login fails

3. **Remember Me Checkbox**
   - Only visible in Electron app (not web version)
   - Checked by default for convenience
   - Saves credentials after successful login

4. **Smart Logout**
   - Clears saved credentials when logging out
   - Prevents auto-login after manual logout

## 🚀 How to Test:

1. **First Login:**
   - Launch Electron app
   - Enter your CNIC and mobile number
   - Make sure "Remember me" is checked
   - Click "Sign In"

2. **Test Auto-Login:**
   - Close the Electron app completely
   - Restart the app
   - Should automatically log you in without entering credentials
   - You'll see "Signing you in automatically..." message

3. **Test Manual Logout:**
   - Click logout in the app
   - Restart the app
   - Should show login form (no auto-login)

## 🔐 Security Features:

- **Encryption**: Credentials encrypted with AES-256-CBC
- **Secure Storage**: Stored in OS user data directory
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Cleared on logout or login failure
- **Electron Only**: Feature only works in desktop app

## 📂 Files Modified:

- `electron/main.js` - Secure storage backend
- `electron/preload.js` - IPC bridge
- `client/src/components/Login.jsx` - Auto-login logic
- `client/src/components/Header.jsx` - Logout cleanup

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

If auto-login isn't working:
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Try logging out and back in manually
3. Credentials are stored in: `{userData}/user-credentials.enc`
4. Delete the file to reset if needed

The feature makes the desktop experience much smoother while maintaining security!
